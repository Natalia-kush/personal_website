        I started my PhD in August 2023.
        I work in the field of Algebraic Statistics under the supervision of [Prof. Kaie Kubjas](https://www.kaiekubjas.com) at the Department of Mathematics and System          Analysis. 

        My research interests are algebraic geometry, combinatorics and their applications to statistics.
